Code for office hours conducted in SPISE


These files may not do what they are named, generally these files were generated in office hours or class.

In order to help students achieve intuition or understand a concept I would write code live for them, and document my thought process while writing.
Many times students input would also be used to arrive at solutions for the code. Feel free to ask about any.
